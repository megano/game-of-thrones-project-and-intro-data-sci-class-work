# HW - Project Milestone - Ideas
=======

Ideas of questions I hope to answer:
-----------
* Option A (**engaged app user**): I’m hoping to predict how likely it is that a new app user will become engaged.
* Option B (**kid mimicry**): I’m hoping to find out if there’s a link between parent’s spending/saving behavior and what their teenage kids do with $. 
* Option C (**spender or saver**): I’m hoping to predict, given a list of traits about a child, likelihood they are a “spender” or “saver”.
* Option D (**good future**): I’m hoping to predict, given a child’s spending/saving patterns and accounts, likelihood they will make bad decisions about money in the future.

What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
-----------
* Option A (**engaged app user**): I have user and app usage data with charactaristics. Planned method: 1) Unsupervised learning w/historical data. 2) Run supervised with features that are identified from unsupervised. 3) Predict who from population of present users will be engaged, make 1 or more recommendations of audience or possible features to focus on for product. 
* Option B (**kid mimicry**): I’m hoping to find out if there’s a link between parent’s spending/saving behavior and what their teenage kids do with $.
* Option C (**spender or saver**): I have kid’s debit card spending, and savings account data.  
* Option D (**good future**): I have what kinds of accounts the child has: checking, saving, debit card, credit card. I have whether they have fees or overages. 


What do you know about the data so far?
----------- 
* Option A (**engaged app user**): I know that we know wealth is one factor in whether users will still be with us 2 months in. I know it’s going to require cleaning. I know we know what marketing channels our users come from.  
* Option B (**kid mimicry**): I have aggregate spending data and can link parents to their children. I don’t know if we store data for longer than 2 months. 
* Option C (**spender or saver**): I know that for kid’s accounts, on an individual purchase basis, in some cases we cannot attribute whether the person who spent the money is the kid or the parent. I know the data is very messy and incomplete. 
* Option D (**good future**): Same as above. 


Why did you choose this topic? 
-----------
* Option A (**engaged app user**): Because if we can correlate what aspects of the app are resonating with sub-sets of users, we can understand how to modularize the app to meet the needs of various target audiences. Also to know where to double down on vs stop spending marketing $s. 
* Option B (**kid mimicry**): Because I’d like to know if kid’s spending/savings patterns mimic their parents or not.
* Option C (**spender or saver**): 
* Option D (**good future**): I'm curious what are the factors that cause a kid to do the right things with their money.
